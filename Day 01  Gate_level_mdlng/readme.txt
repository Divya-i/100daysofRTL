# 100-days-of-rtl challenge

Welcome to the "100 Days of RTL Challenge" repository! This repository is part of a 100-day journey to explore and master RTL (Register Transfer Level) design using the Verilog hardware description language. Join me as we delve into various aspects of RTL design to enhance skills and understanding.

Day 01: Gate-Level Modeling

On Day 1, my focus is on gate-level modeling using Verilog. We will design and simulate basic logic gatesâ€”AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR. This exercise will allow us to observe the behavior of these gates under different input conditions, including logic values 0, 1, x (unknown), and z (high-impedance).
