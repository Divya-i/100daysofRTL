## Day 06: Half Subtractor Modeling

Welcome to Day 6 of the "100 Days of RTL Challenge"! Today, I'll have explored modeling techniques for a Half Subtractor. Covered gate-level modeling, data flow modeling, and behavioral modeling.

### Half Subtractor Modeling

A Half Subtractor is a fundamental digital logic circuit used to subtract two binary numbers. It has two inputs, A (minuend) and B (subtrahend), and two outputs: Difference (D) and Borrow (B_out). I'll implement it using three different modeling techniques.

### 1. Gate-Level Modeling

In gate-level modeling, I'll have designed the Half Subtractor using basic logical gates like XOR, AND, and NOT gates. This approach provides insight into the physical circuit's structure.

### 2. Data Flow Modeling

Data flow modeling describes the behavior of the circuit based on the flow of data between registers. I have implemented the Half Subtractor using continuous assignments, specifying how data flows continuously between inputs and outputs.

### 3. Behavioral Modeling

Behavioral modeling focuses on defining the functionality of the circuit without specifying its structure. created a behavioral model of the half-subtractor using high-level descriptions, making it more abstract and versatile.
