## Day 5: Full Adder Modeling Techniques

Welcome to Day 5 of the "100 Days of RTL Challenge"! Today, I'll be exploring modeling techniques for a Full Adder, building on what I learned with the Half Adder. I'll cover gate-level modeling, data flow modeling, and behavioral modeling for the Full Adder.

### Full Adder Modeling

A Full Adder is an important component in digital arithmetic. It adds three binary numbers and produces two outputs: Sum (S) and Carry (C_out). I'll implement it using three different modeling techniques.

### 1. Gate-Level Modeling

I'll design the Full Adder using basic logical gates like XOR, AND, OR, and others in gate-level modeling. This approach is explicit and provides insight into the physical circuit.

### 2. Data Flow Modeling

Data flow modeling describes the circuit's behavior based on the data flow between registers. I'll implement the Full Adder using continuous assignments, specifying how data flows continuously between inputs and outputs.

### 3. Behavioral Modeling

Behavioral modeling focuses on defining the circuit's functionality without specifying its structure. I'll create a behavioral model of the Full Adder using high-level descriptions, making it more abstract and versatile.

Stay tuned as I delve into each modeling technique for the Full Adder throughout the day! Happy modeling!
