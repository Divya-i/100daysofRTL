Day 5: Full-Adder Modeling Techniques

Welcome to Day 5 of the "100 Days of RTL Challenge"! Today, I'll explore modeling techniques for a Full Adder, building on what I learned with the Half Adder. I'll cover gate-level modeling, data flow modeling, and behavioral modeling for the Full Adder.

### Full-Adder Modeling

A full adder is an essential component in digital arithmetic. It adds three binary numbers and produces two outputs: Sum (S) and Carry (C_out). I'll implement it using three different modeling techniques.

### 1. Gate-Level Modeling

I have designed the Full Adder using basic logical gates like XOR, AND, OR, and others in gate-level modeling. This approach is explicit and provides insight into the physical circuit.

### 2. Data Flow Modeling

Data flow modeling describes the circuit's behavior based on the data flow between registers. I have implemented the Full Adder using continuous assignments, specifying how data flows continuously between inputs and outputs.

### 3. Behavioral Modeling

Behavioral modeling focuses on defining the circuit's functionality without specifying its structure. I created a behavioral model of the Full Adder using high-level descriptions, making it more abstract and versatile.
