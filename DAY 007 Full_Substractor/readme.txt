## Day 07: Full Subtractor Modeling

Welcome to Day 7 of the "100 Days of RTL Challenge"! Today, I have  explored three modeling techniques for a Full Subtractor: gate-level modeling, data flow modeling, and behavioral modeling.

### Full Subtractor Modeling

A Full Subtractor is a fundamental digital logic circuit used for binary subtraction, taking three inputs (A, B, and Borrow-In) and producing two outputs (Difference and Borrow-Out).

### Modeling Techniques

1. Gate-Level Modeling: This approach designs the Full Subtractor using basic logical gates (XOR, AND, NOT) to understand its physical circuit structure.

2. Data Flow Modeling: Describes the behavior based on data flow between registers, including how Borrow-Out is computed.

3. Behavioral Modeling: Focuses on functionality without specifying structure, creating an abstract and versatile model.

Join me in exploring each modeling technique for the Full Subtractor! Happy modeling!
