## Day 04: Half Adder Modeling Techniques

Welcome to Day 4 of the "100 Days of RTL Challenge"! Today, I have explored multiple modeling techniques for a half-adder. like gate-level modeling, data flow modeling, and behavioral modeling.

### Half Adder Modeling

A half-adder is a fundamental digital logic circuit used for binary addition. It has two inputs, A and B, and two outputs: Sum (S) and Carry (C). We'll implement it using three different modeling techniques.

### 1. Gate-Level Modeling

In gate-level modeling, we'll design the half-adder using basic logical gates like XOR and AND gates. This approach is explicit and provides insight into the physical circuit.

### 2. Data Flow Modeling

Data flow modeling describes the behavior of the circuit based on the flow of data between registers. We'll implement the half-adder using continuous assignments, specifying how data flows continuously between inputs and outputs.

### 3. Behavioral Modeling

Behavioral modeling focuses on defining the functionality of the circuit without specifying its structure. We'll create a behavioral model of the half-adder using high-level descriptions, making it more abstract and versatile.
