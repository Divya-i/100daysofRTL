## Day 04: Half Adder Gate-Level Modeling

Welcome to Day 4 of the "100 Days of RTL Challenge"! Today, we'll focus on gate-level modeling to design and simulate a half-adder. A Half Adder adds two binary numbers and produces two outputs: Sum (S) and Carry (C).

### Half Adder Gate-Level Modeling

In gate-level modeling, we design circuits by explicitly specifying the logical gates and their interconnections. Let's build a half-adder using basic logic gates like XOR and AND gates.
